    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "Out of 70,594 total clients, **47,787** successfully completed the process (reached step 4), resulting in a completion rate of approximately **67.7%**.  \n",

    "#### **Key Insights:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Clients Who Finished (47,787):  \n",
    "  These clients reached the final step (step 4), successfully completing the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Total Unique Clients (70,594):  \n",
    "  This is the total number of distinct clients in the dataset, calculated using `nunique()` on `client_id`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Completion Rate: Completion Rate = (47,787 / 70,594) × 100 ≈ 67.7%  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Client Drop-off (32.3%): A total of 22,807 clients (70,594 - 47,787) did not finish the process. This represents a drop-off or abandonment rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implications:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Process Effectiveness: A completion rate of 67.7% may indicate good engagement, but there is room for improvement depending on project goals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential Goals: If 80% or higher is the target, interventions may be needed to reduce drop-offs and improve completion rates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Follow-up Suggestions:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze Drop-off Points: Identify where most clients drop off (e.g., step 2 or step 3). This can help locate friction points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Segment Clients: Study client characteristics (e.g., demographics, behavior) to see if certain groups are more likely to drop off or complete the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat Completions: Investigate whether some clients completed the process multiple times and consider focusing on unique client completions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Retention Link: Explore whether completing the process correlates with retention or customer loyalty to gauge its impact on long-term success.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "With a **67.7% completion rate**, the process appears moderately successful but highlights opportunities to reduce the **32.3% drop-off rate**. This data provides a strong foundation for refining the process and setting achievable performance targets."

    "### **How:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the average time clients spend on each step of a process, the code uses timestamp data and computes time differences between consecutive steps. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the Data:  \n",
    "   - Ensure the `date_time` column is in the correct datetime format for calculations.  \n",
    "   - Sort the dataframe by `client_id`, `visit_id`, and `step` to maintain chronological order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Time Spent Per Step:  \n",
    "   - Create a `time_spent` column by subtracting the current step’s `date_time` from the next step’s timestamp (`shift(-1)`).  \n",
    "   - Handle step 4 (final step):  \n",
    "     - Set `next_step_time` to the maximum `date_time` within each `visit_id`, assuming this marks the session's end.  \n",
    "     - Recalculate `time_spent` for step 4 based on this value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute Averages:  \n",
    "   - Group the data by `client_id` and `step`.  \n",
    "   - Calculate the mean time spent on each step for each client.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generate Final Dataframe:  \n",
    "   - Create a new dataframe, `avg_time_per_step`, with the following columns:  \n",
    "     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier.  \n",
    "     - `step`: Step number (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).  \n",
    "     - `avg_time_spent`: Average time spent as a timedelta object.  \n",
    "     - `avg_time_seconds`: Average time in seconds.  \n",
    "     - `avg_time_minutes`: Average time in minutes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output:**  \n",
    "The function returns the `avg_time_per_step` dataframe, which shows the average time spent by each client at each step. This helps identify bottlenecks or areas needing improvement by revealing how long clients typically spend on each stage."

    "- The **F-statistic** measures how much the group means differ relative to the variability within the groups. A higher value indicates larger differences between groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Significant Differences Between Groups:\n",
    "   - ANOVA results show statistically significant differences in average balances among groups (p-value ≈ 2.67e-11).\n",
    "   - Tukey's post-hoc test identifies the specific group comparisons with significant differences:\n",
    "     - **Control vs Test**: The Test group has significantly higher average balances compared to the Control group (meandiff ≈ 3432.54).\n",
    "     - **Control vs Unknown**: The Unknown group has significantly lower average balances compared to the Control group (meandiff ≈ -5195.64).\n",
    "     - **Test vs Unknown**: The Unknown group has significantly lower average balances compared to the Test group (meandiff ≈ -8628.18).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization Insights:\n",
    "   - Tukey's plot shows that the Test group has the highest average balance, the Control group is in the middle, and the Unknown group has the lowest average.\n",
    "   - Error bars do not overlap significantly, supporting the statistical findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- The analysis indicates that the groups are not balanced in terms of their average initial balances. This imbalance, particularly the significantly lower average for the Unknown group, may affect the fairness of the experiment.\n",
    "- Differences in initial balances might influence participant behavior, potentially impacting the experimental outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications for the Experiment:\n",
    "- Experimental Design:\n",
    "   - The disparity in initial balances could bias results and should be accounted for in future analyses.\n",
    "   - Controlling or adjusting for these differences (e.g., through statistical techniques like ANCOVA) is recommended to ensure a clearer understanding of the experimental effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow-up Suggestions:\n",
    "   - Investigate if other variables (e.g., customer tenure or number of accounts) also show similar imbalances.\n",
    "   - Consider redesigning the experiment to ensure more homogeneous group assignments or apply statistical adjustments for existing disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the results highlight significant differences between groups, the initial imbalances in average balances must be considered to accurately interpret the experimental findings. Adjustments or redesign may be necessary to ensure robust conclusions.\n"

    "- **Test Group:** 69.77% completion rate  \n",
    "- **Control Group:** 65.90% completion rate  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **test group** (new design) outperformed the **control group** (old design), suggesting the new design encourages more completions.\n",

    "#### Statistical Significance:  \n",
    "- **Z-score:** 9.82  \n",
    "- **P-value:** 0.0000  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Z-score** is high, and the **p-value** is very low, indicating the difference is **statistically significant** and not due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis Testing:  \n",
    "- The **null hypothesis** (no difference) is **rejected**.  \n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis** (test group performs better) is **accepted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Implications:  \n",
    "- The new design appears to be **more effective** and is likely the better option.  \n",
    "- The large difference suggests the result is **reliable** and not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Interval:  \n",
    "The 95% confidence interval shows the true difference is unlikely to be zero, confirming the result’s reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps:  \n",
    "1. **Implement the new design**: Given the positive results, consider adopting it.  \n",
    "2. **Evaluate costs**: Assess whether the improved completion rate justifies any additional costs.  \n",
    "3. **Continue testing**: Perform further tests to ensure consistent results across different users or situations.\n",

    "#### Final Takeaway:  \n",
    "The new design leads to more completions and the result is statistically significant. If the benefits outweigh the costs, proceed with implementing it."
