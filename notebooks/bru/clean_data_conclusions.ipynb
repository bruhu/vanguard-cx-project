    "- `client_age (int)`: The age of the client in years.\n",
    "- `gender`: The gender of the client. The value can be \"Male,\" \"Female,\" or \"Unspecified,\" meaning the gender data is either recorded or missing.\n",
    "- `num_accounts (int)`: The number of accounts the client has with the company.\n",
    "- `balance (float)`: The total balance of the client's accounts with the company. This is a monetary value, and the balance can indicate how much money the client holds across their accounts.\n",
    "- `calls_last_6_months (int)`: The number of calls the client has made to the company in the past six months. This can give an idea of how actively the client has engaged with the company.\n",
    "- `logons_last_6_months (int)`: The number of times the client has logged into their account or interacted with the company online in the past six months.\n",
    "- `variation (object)`: This column likely indicates whether the client is part of a control group or a test group for an experiment. In this case, clients are either labeled as \"Test\", \"Control\", or \"Unknown\"."

    "The result *\"Clients who finished the process: 47,787 out of 70,594\"* provides a summary of how many clients in the dataset have successfully completed the process (reached the final step, which is step 4 in this case), compared to the total number of clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Breaking Down the Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clients who finished the process (47,787):**\n",
    "This number represents the clients who reached the final step (step 4) in the project or process. It's a count of how many clients successfully completed the entire journey or task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total unique clients (70,594):**\n",
    "This is the total number of unique clients in the dataset. The client_id column likely represents individual clients, and nunique() is used to count how many distinct clients are in the dataset, regardless of how many steps they completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Can We Infer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of clients who finished the process to the total number of clients can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completion Rate = 47,78770,594 × 100 ≈ 67.7%**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completion Rate = 70,59447,787​ × 100 ≈ 67.7%**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, about 67.7% of the clients who started the process completed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client Drop-off:**\n",
    "The remaining 32.3% of clients (70,594 - 47,787 = 22,807) did not reach the final step. This could indicate a drop-off or abandonment rate, where clients started but didn’t finish.\n",
    "Understanding the reasons for this drop-off (e.g., user experience issues, complexity, lack of incentives) could help improve the process or identify areas for intervention to increase completion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implications for Project Metrics:**\n",
    "A 67.7% completion rate can be seen as relatively good in many contexts, especially if the process is long or involves several steps. However, in some industries or projects, you may want to aim for a higher completion rate.\n",
    "If this is a metric for performance or KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), you might want to set a target (e.g., 80% completion rate) and use this data to track progress toward that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Potential Follow-up Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examine the Drop-off Points:**\n",
    "You might want to analyze where the drop-offs occur in the steps leading up to step 4. For instance, do most clients drop off at a specific step (e.g., step 3), or is the drop-off more evenly distributed?\n",
    "Investigating this can give insight into potential bottlenecks or friction points in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment Clients:**\n",
    "Segmenting clients by other characteristics (e.g., demographics, usage patterns, source of acquisition) could reveal if some groups are more likely to complete the process than others. This could help tailor interventions for high-value or at-risk clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Completions:**\n",
    "If some clients complete the process multiple times (as might be possible in certain scenarios), this could skew the results. You could consider focusing on unique clients who completed the process at least once versus total completions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client Retention:**\n",
    "If the process completion rate is tied to retention or customer loyalty (e.g., users who finish the process are more likely to stay), then this result could be a strong indicator of overall client engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The result shows that **approximately 67.7% of clients successfully completed the process, while about 32.3% did not**. This completion rate could be a useful KPI for understanding how effectively the project is engaging and retaining clients, as well as identifying areas for improvement in the process.\n"

    "Once we know the completion rates for both the Test Group and the Control Group, we check if the difference between them is big enough to be **statistically significant** (i.e., it’s not just due to random chance).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Combine the two groups**: First, we calculate the overall completion rate for both groups combined (this is called the \"pooled proportion\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the \"Standard Error\" (SE)**: This tells us how much the completion rates can vary. It’s like measuring the \"spread\" or \"noise\" in the data. If the groups are very similar, the SE will be small. If they’re very different, the SE will be bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check if the SE is valid**: If the SE can’t be calculated (which might happen with extreme data), we skip the test and show an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Z-score**: This is the key number we use to see if the difference between the two groups is big enough to be important. The Z-score is how many times bigger the difference is compared to the SE.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find the p-value**: This tells us the likelihood that the difference we see is just by chance. A smaller p-value means the difference is more likely to be real and not due to randomness. If the p-value is less than 0.05 (5%), we say the difference is **statistically significant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Z-test checks if the difference between the groups is big enough to be confident that it’s not just random. If it is, we can say the difference is \"real\"."

    "### **Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completion Rate Comparison:\n",
    "- **Test Group**: 69.77% completion rate\n",
    "- **Control Group**: 65.90% completion rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The **test group** (with the new design) has a higher completion rate than the **control group** (with the old design). This suggests the new design works better at getting people to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Significance:\n",
    "- **Z-score**: 9.82 (a really big number!)\n",
    "- **P-value**: 0.0000 (way smaller than 0.05)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Z-score** is really high, showing a big difference between the two groups. The **p-value** is super small, which means the difference is **not by chance** – it’s real.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We Believe:\n",
    "- The idea that **there’s no difference** (null hypothesis) is **rejected**.\n",
    "- We accept that the **test group** does better (alternative hypothesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Means in Practice:\n",
    "- Since the test group performed better, the new design seems like a **better option** than the old one.\n",
    "- The difference is so big that it’s **probably not random**. The result is solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Interval:\n",
    "- The 95% confidence interval shows that the true difference isn’t zero, which means the test result is reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to Do Next:\n",
    "1. **Use the new design**: The new design works better, so consider using it.\n",
    "2. **Check if it’s worth the cost**: See if the better completion rate is worth any extra costs.\n",
    "3. **Test more**: Before rolling it out to everyone, keep testing to make sure it works well everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Takeaway:\n",
    "- The test shows that the new design helps people complete more actions. It’s a **real difference**, so go ahead with it, as long as the benefits outweigh any extra costs.\n",
